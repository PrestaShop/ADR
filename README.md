# ADR

Architecture Decision Records for the PrestaShop project

## What is this?

The purpose of this repository is to track the history of design choices on the PrestaShop project.

To learn more about ADRs, read [this article][adr].

## How do I propose a subject?

1) Use [ADR tools][adr-tools] to build your proposal, add it to the status table below, then submit a Pull Request.

2) New proposals initial status is "In discussion". If the subject is accepted for discussion, it is assigned an ID and added to the table below on `master` branch.

3) Once the discussion is over and after all necessary ADR modifications, a vote is cast in the related Pull Request.

4) All project maintainers vote, and their vote is registered. Decisions are accepted by simple majority. Discussed ADRs are merged even if they are not accepted.
